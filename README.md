# Travelling-through-time-using-music

How to use it , 
when you run pycharm , you will need spotify id , and secret key. 
replace these 2 elements with your own spotify id and secret key.
when you run the code for the first time , it will open a browser window , copy the URL and paste it into the console of pycharm. 
restart pycharm and you will get a cache file in your working directory.
now when you run the code , it will ask for a date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
when you enter this date, it will go to billboard.com and get the list of top 100 songs on that date using web scraping.
next , it will create a new playlist on your spotify id with the name of that date that you entered at the beginning.
then , it will add the top 100 songs to this playlist so you can enjoy a trip to that era when ever you want.
